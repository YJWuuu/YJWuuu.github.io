			<h1>Autobiography</h1>
			<section>
				Hi, I am Yen-Ju Wu from Tainan city. I am currently a senior in the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University. Since my father also graduated from the Department of EE, I was taught and influenced by my father when I was a child, and developed some interests on mathematics. My mother used to be an English teacher. She is now retired. My sister is an accountant.<br/><br/>

				I am not an outgoing person, but I love making new friends. I enjoy chatting with my friends. I am optimistic. I seldom feel frustrated when facing difficulties. When encountering a problem, I will try to understand the cause and do my best to solve it. In terms of studying, I am a hardworking student. I require myself to thoroughly understand the content related to courses. After all, this is the duty of a student. I value the importance of hard work since this is the only way to succeed in whatever fields.<br/><br/>

				Speaking of my interest, I am fond of table tennis. I used to be a member of my high school table tennis team. I often play table tennis with my friends to alleviate pressure from my study in my spare time. I am interested in robots, and that is what I do in my special research. We made a modular robot composed of three same modules. We used Genetic Algorithm to control the robot. We have successfully made the robot to evolve from genes generated by completely random numbers to ones that can crawl and climb stairs. This is an unforgettable memory of my life.<br/><br/>

				I will graduate in one year. After graduation, I would like to apply for a graduate school in the United States. I hope that I will be able to use what I have learned to make breakthroughs in areas that may not have been explored. I also hope to be able to work in the United States in the future.
