				<h1>Special experience of My Life</h1>
				<p>
					<img src="./img/statue.jpg" style="height: 50vh; float: left; margin-right: 3vh;" >When I was four years old, I almost became French. Our family traveled to France with my mother’s colleagues for seven days. One afternoon we visited the Louvre, which is one of the five largest museums in the world. At that time, my mother was busy making videos and wanted to record the magnificent and gorgeous Louvre. At the age of four, I was attracted by the crowds of pigeons in the square. I chased the pigeons everywhere, imagining that I was playing tag with the pigeons. But whenever I approached it slowly and quietly, it would fly away so quickly that I cannot even get close to them, so I kept running and running to find the next target. When I regain my composure, the surrounding scenery was no longer the one I recognize. There were tourists everywhere, but I just couldn't find my family. I burst out crying and yelling, "Mom!" Suddenly, A foreigner held me up. He seemed to know that I was speaking Chinese, so he took me to another person who could speak Chinese. The man took me down to the basement of the square, probably because he wanted to take me to the service desk. I still remember the shouting at that time. I shouted: "My mother is upstairs." At this moment, my mother was about to walk from the square to the basement and found me at the stairs. Not only my family, but all mom's colleagues were able to load off their minds. I have no memory of where I have been during the whole tour, but I will probably never forget this experience. When I was growing up, my family often told me that I almost became French when I was four.
